# DiscordBot
A fun discord bot I made for me and my friends that contains a large number of image-editing and search commands.
I used ImageMagick for the image editing commands, and big credit goes to Fred at http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php as I used a lot of the scripts from here.
Also credit to https://github.com/kairess/cat_hipsterizer and https://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2/download, I used the data files from here to do face detection.
This repository is just to show the main functionality, not all files are there that are needed for it to work such as the face detection data files and images.
